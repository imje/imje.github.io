            <p>
                With a new generation of children growing up in
                urban areas, there is a challenge to decrease the
                cognitive distance to what goes into food production.
                Insight into foods origin, production of foodstuffs
                and the road from food to meal is on the National
                Curriculum as of kindergarten. Seeing as dietary
                habits that are established at a young age, are most
                often continued later in life; it is beneficial to address
                this at an early age. Giving children the knowledge
                and tools for critical thinking about the food they eat
                can have impact on their carbon footptint.

        <h2 class=" mb-4 text-2xl tracking-tight font-bold text-left text-gray-900">Methods</h2>

        <p>
            The main method of acquiring information was
            through literature studies, as well as exploring
            existing products and possibilities. We had originally
            arranged for a meeting with a kindergarten to
            gather first-hand experiences and further ahead
            do focus groups and test concepts with children.
            Unfortunately, the Corona-outbreak rendered this
            method futile. Pursuing the commercial market,
            we turned to even further literature studies, a
            digital survey, as well as our own experiences with
            cookbooks and children.

            <h2 class=" mb-4 text-2xl tracking-tight font-bold text-left text-gray-900">Users and distribution</h2>

            <p>
                The primary users is children between 3 and 10
                years of age. Children are highly impressionable,
                and habits that are established at a young age are
                often continued later in life. Seeing as most often it is
                the parents who have the biggest influence on their
                children, and responsible for purchases, they are the
                target buyers and secondary users.
                <br><br>
                The book will be distibuted through book
                stores both online and physical. One can envision
                several types of marketing, both targeted ads
                through social media and collaborations with
                renowned names and organizations.

            <h2 class=" mb-4 text-2xl tracking-tight font-bold text-left text-gray-900">Our goal</h2>

            <p>
                Our goal is that the book is going to be more than just a regular recipe book. We
                want it to start a conversation about sustainability and food between the child
                and their parents. It is therefore envisaged that the child and their parents will
                do several of the tasks together, so they can learn and explore in fellowship. In
                addition, we want the book to plant a seed of consciousness in the child. This is
                done by introducing the child to information, tasks, and facts they can reflect
                upon. Not least, we want to encourage to activity. Therefore, we are including an
                activity for every recipe of the book. The goal is that the activities shall help create
                an understanding of the relationship between food and sustainability in the child.

            <h2 class=" mb-4 text-2xl tracking-tight font-bold text-left text-gray-900">Value and impact</h2>

            <p>
                Through practicing food sustainability, the children will be empowered to explore
                values, construct knowledge, and develop an appreciation of the environment and
                the food they are eating. From a climate perspective, it is of great value to learn
                children about environmental issues connected to food. This will make them think
                about the consequences of their food choices and behavior. What we are teaching
                children today is going to affect their lifestyle choices in the future. Giving
                children the knowledge and tools for critical thinking about the food they eat, can
                make a big impact on both greenhouse gas-emissions and public health, since a
                person's diet and food choices makes up a large part of their carbon footprint.

                    Each recipe is tailored to convey knowledge about one or more goal.
                    They are seasonality, dietary choices impact on climate, growing, animal
                    welfare and local produce. This recipe aims to give a consciousness about
                    the dietary choicesâ€™ impact on climate by means of resource utilization.

                    The layout and graphics aim to be colorful, playful and familiar to
                    children. The hand drawn lines, illustrations and freeform shapes creates a playful
                    feeling. At the same time, the colors, symbols and frames stays coherent throughout
                    the recipes, which makes each page familiar and intuitive to understand.

                <p>
                    The intention is that
                    children can partake
                    actively in cooking
                    with their parents. The
                    recipes are simplified and
                    instructions written so that
                    they are easy to follow by
                    children. Even so, some
                    steps would likely require
                    guidance from adults,
                    which makes for teachable
                    moments between parent
                    and child.

                <p>
                    To further the learning outcome, background information is
                    presented on ingredients, underlying foodsystems etcetera. The topics that
                    come up can be comprehensive and difficult, thus great effort is put into
                    creating examples and illustrations that intuitively convey the message.

                <p>
                    Each recipe has an activity besides cooking linked to it. The activities are made so that the children better
                    engage with the book, hopefully sparking creativity and joy. For example in this recipe, a slider is embedded in the
                    page, so the child can pull on and reveal the difference. In other recipes we have seed paper you can rip out and
                    plant, a map to mark out the foods origin, draw a line between the right animal and product and so on.

                    The book series is
                    called The incredible journey
                    of food, which is in reference
                    to the food system as well
                    as the process of cooking
                    food and creating something
                    with different foods. In this
                    book the topic is Â«foods you
                    know - from scratchÂ». The
                    recipes is based on processed
                    foods and how to make
                    them from scratch, such as:
                    ketchup. pasta, jam and fish
                    fingers. In other editions of
                    the book the topics could be:
                    seasonality, regions of the
                    world, favorite dinners etc.
