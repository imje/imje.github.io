        <h2 class="mb-4 text-2xl tracking-tight font-bold text-left text-gray-900">Project description</h2>
            <p>
                The project was to create a backpack light for children, so that they are more visible in the dark.
                The light should shine continuously when turned on. 
                It is powered by 2 x CR1220 batteries, and they must be replaceable.
                The light is price sensitive, so it should have a simple production process.
                The project was done over four weeks.

            <h3 class="mb-4 text-xl tracking-tight font-bold text-left text-gray-900">The user</h3>
            <p>The target user is a first grader (6 years old).
                From doing some research on toys for children and making a moodboard, the key qualities I wanted the light to have was:
                <li>
                    Vibrant colors
                </li>
                <li>
                    A simple shape
                </li>
                <br>
                Children are creative and when seeing simple shapes, they can imagine it to be many things. Therefore I chose not to make e.g. a unicorn shaped light. Then it would only be the children that like unicorns that would want the light.

            <p>
                One of the lights I disassembled was cheap, but worked well. The technical design was well done, but the estetic was not too good in my opinion.
                The light was combined of many parts, and when changing the batteries it would be a little difficult to put it back together.
                It was difficult to understand if you should push the button or slide it to turn the light on. 
                The light did not light up well.
                <br>
                <br>
                Another light I looked at was rechargeable and had a more figurative design. As stated in the research this was not desirable.

            <h3 class="mb-4 text-xl tracking-tight font-bold text-left text-gray-900">Shape</h3>
            <p>I started out with drawing several ideas. 
                <br><br>
                In the first sketch the light would only emit on one side of the light. 
                This would be a problem if the light turned while dangling on the backpack. 
                This could be solved by using a strap to fix the light tight to the backpack, 
                or as I chose to do: have the light emit on all sides.
                <br><br>
                I also sketched different shapes, and ended up with a rectangular prism with rounded edges.
                <br><br>
                I also wanted the light to have a function even if it was turned off. 
                This was because I think it is not easy to always remember to turn the light on. 
                Therefore I chose to integrate a reflective surface on each side of the prism

            <p>
                I carved out some different shapes in foam to look at both the shape in 3D and to figure out the size of the light. First 
                The light ended up being 30mm tall, 20mm wide and 15mm in depth.

            <p>
                The lamp is only assembled with snaps.
                <br><br>
                Inside the lamp there are gussets to hold the PCB in place and to strengthen the structure.
                <br><br>
                To hang the light on the backpack there is a velcro strap attached to the PCB and threaded through a hole in the prism. 
                All the holes on the lamp are placed on the parting line to make the production process as cheap as possible.

            <p>
                The main method of prototyping used is 3D-printing. 
                I did not manage to 3D-print a reflective surface, so how the final product should look is represented in the renders below. 
                The print was used to show functionality and assembly, and also to determine if the different details worked.
